# Benefits of object oriented programming?

'''
- Reusable code, DRY principle through inheritance 
- Modularity; can make changes in one part without causing cascade of errors
- Thinking of objects in our code as real world 'things' that have behaviour
    and state (data) that belongs to them-Easier to conceptulize about our program
- Expandable code; can make extensions without breaking the entire program
- Encapsulation; objects and data are self-contained, maintaining privacy and
    protection of private data
- Abstraction; Internal workings are abstracted away because of encapsulation,
    freeing up thinking to focus on bigger problems and working with bigger
    programs

Additional benefits:
- Polymorphism; Helps with code reuse, allows objects of different types to use
    the same method calls, helps with simplification and decoupling-we don't
    need to know the specifics, we can just call the method
- Reusable code through composition; the use of objects of another class within
    a composing class to make use of thier functionality. 
- Similar to composition, Collaboration can allow for the creation of complex
    objects whilst reusing functionality by using instances of other classes to
    complete thier own tasks

LS:
- 'The interaction of many small parts, rather than one massive blob of dependancy'
