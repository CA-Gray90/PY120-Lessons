# Initial idea for board display:

'x' mark:
\/
/\

'o' mark:
/\
\/

eg:

 \/ |    | /\
 /\ |    | \/
----+----+----
 /\ | \/ |
 \/ | /\ |
----+----+----
    |    | \/
    |    | /\

Empty board:
    |    |
    |    |
----+----+----
    |    |
    |    |
----+----+----
    |    |
    |    |


* Will need to watch out for '\' being an escape sequence.

Board functionality:

 1 | 2 | 3
---+---+---
 4 | 5 | 6
---+---+---
 7 | 8 | 9

Squares are numbered as above:

Optional numpad layout?

 7 | 8 | 9
---+---+---
 4 | 5 | 6
---+---+---
 1 | 2 | 3
